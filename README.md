# lowRogue
My first attempt at creating a video game. It is written in C using ncurses library to create a roguelike game.
My only goals for this project is to explore the C language, and use Git for version control to map my progress and keep my code safe.

To run lowRogue ncurses library is required and must be included when building the game ie:
```
gcc main.c -lncurses
```
